			<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>

			<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
			<p>I recently got married in June.</p>
			<p><span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;">I am currently a nurse and am in the process of a career change.</span></p>
			<p>I have been trying to learn how to program in C# with my husband.</p>

			<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
			<p>My current hobbies are learning to write code and playing racquetball with my husband.</p>
			<p>My husband has been a software developer for about 3.5 years. Recently, he has started introducing me to software development and helping me write simple programs in C#.</p>
			<p>In our free time, we like to go to the YMCA and play racquetball for a couple of hours. I had no idea how exhausting that would be when I agreed to it.</p>
