	<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
	<p>Hello, my name is Kayla Stanley and I am 23 years old.</p>
	<p>This is my first project using html.</p>
	<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
	<p>I recently got married in June.</p>
	<p>I am currently a nurse and am in the process of a career change.</p>
	<p>I have been trying to learn how to program in C# with my husband.</p>
	<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
	<p>My current hobbies are learning to write code and playing racquetball with my husband.</p>
	<p>My husband has been a software developer for about 3.5 years. Recently, he has started introducing me to software development and helping me write simple programs in C#.</p>
	<p>In our free time, we like to go to the YMCA and play racquetball for a couple of hours. I had no idea how exhausting that would be when I agreed to it.</p>
