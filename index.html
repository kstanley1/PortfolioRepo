			<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
			<p>My current hobbies are learning to write code and playing racquetball with my husband.</p>
			<p>My husband has been a software developer for about 3.5 years. Recently, he has started introducing me to software development and helping me write simple programs in C#.</p>
			<p>In our free time, we like to go to the YMCA and play racquetball for a couple of hours. I had no idea how exhausting that would be when I agreed to it.</p>
